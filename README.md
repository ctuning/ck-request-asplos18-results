This repository contains validated workflows and results in the [open CK format](https://github.com/ctuning/ck)
from the reproducible [ReQuEST@ASPLOS'18 tournament](http://cknowledge.org/request-cfp-asplos2018.html) 
on optimization and co-design of Pareto-efficient SW/HW stack for deep learning based inference (image classification).
You can browse these results in the [live ReQuEST scoreboard](http://cKnowledge.org/request-results):
